# Local inference

<span class="source-label">Owner: meddeid</span>

`meddeid` is the package used to de-identify text. It supports individual notes,
batches, Python applications, and an optional internal web service. Release
Release `0.1.1` is available from PyPI and as the production API image on GHCR.

## Availability today

The public model, Python packages, source repositories, and model-bundled CPU
image are available. Command-line, Python, batch, HTTP, and hardened local
Compose use are released. GPU-optimized releases, a public demo, and a managed
endpoint are not available yet.

For the least technical path, install Docker and run this from the `meddeid`
repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stighellemans/meddeid.git
cd meddeid
./scripts/start-local.sh
```

This generates authentication, pulls and starts the published image, and prints
the single-note browser interface and technical API documentation addresses.

Install all Python interfaces from PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install 'meddeid[server]'
```

Use `meddeid[server]==0.1.1` when a reproducible installation must pin this
release exactly.

## One note

```bash
meddeid deidentify note.txt
```

The command uses the published Dutch synthetic model by default. The model is cached locally after its first download; the note itself is not sent to Hugging Face.

## A batch of notes

```bash
meddeid batch project/splits/test.jsonl \
  --output predictions/test.jsonl
```

The output can be opened directly in the annotation tools or evaluated with `meddeid-eval`. MedDeID also saves the model version, settings, and timing information needed to reproduce the run.

For a study, use `--revision` to keep the model version fixed. Use `--device cpu`, `--device mps`, or `--device cuda` only when automatic selection is inappropriate.

## Python

```python
from meddeid import Deidentifier

deidentifier = Deidentifier.from_pretrained(
    "stighellemans/meddeid-dutch-synth",
    revision="<immutable-hub-sha>",
)
result = deidentifier(
    "Patiënt Alex Voorbeeld kwam op controle.",
    metadata={"patient": {"given_name": "Alex", "family_name": "Voorbeeld"}},
)
deidentifier.close()
```

Trusted information already known by the hospital, such as a patient or caregiver name, can help catch identifiers the model missed. This information is not added to the model input. Incorrect values can cause unnecessary redaction, so validate them carefully.

## HTTP service

```bash
MEDDEID_DEVICE=cpu meddeid-server
```

The service exposes:

- `POST /deidentify` for one document;
- `POST /deidentify-batch` for throughput-oriented batches;
- `GET /health` for model identity and readiness.

Protect the service with authentication, encrypted connections, access controls, request limits, and safe logging before making it available on a network.

## Containers and GPU serving

The public `ghcr.io/stighellemans/meddeid-api:0.1.1` image pins its dependencies
and model, supports AMD64 and ARM64, and includes an SBOM and provenance.
Compose binds only to localhost and applies non-root, read-only,
capability-free, bounded-process, rotating-log, API-key, and health-check
defaults.

A production GPU deployment still needs a model build prepared and tested for
its specific target hardware.

## Offline and air-gapped use

Download a fixed model copy before entering the air-gapped environment:

```bash
hf download stighellemans/meddeid-dutch-synth \
  --revision <immutable-hub-sha> \
  --local-dir ./meddeid-dutch-synth

meddeid deidentify note.txt --model ./meddeid-dutch-synth
```

Transfer and validate the complete directory rather than copying only the model weights. The other files are also required for correct predictions.

## Production checklist

- Keep the exact model version fixed.
- Validate recall and unnecessary redaction on representative local data.
- Keep source notes, predictions, run records, caches, and logs inside the approved boundary.
- Configure concurrency only after measuring memory and latency on target hardware.
- Monitor model identity and health, not patient content.
- Define a human-review path for high-consequence use.
